# The 8-Bit CPU Simulator
This simulation provides a comprehensive way to understand how a simple 8-bit processor works:

## Visual Components:

Register Bank: Shows the current values of all registers (A, B, C, D, PC, SP, IR, and FLAGS)

ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit): Displays inputs and flag states

Control Unit: Shows the current opcode, operand, and next instruction address

Memory Display: Visualizes the first 32 bytes of memory, with highlighting for active addresses

Execution Log: Real-time log of instructions being executed


## Interactive Controls:

Run/Pause: Start or pause the CPU execution

Step: Execute a single instruction cycle (when paused)

Load Sample Program: Load a demo program that performs basic arithmetic

Load Counter: Load a simple counter program

Clock Speed: Adjust the execution speed


## CPU Features:

8-bit data width

256 bytes of memory (0x00-0xFF)

Basic instruction set with 11 instructions
